#### 什么是VQA?

 	Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a computer vision task where a system is given a text-based question about an image, and it must infer the answer.

​	A robust VQA systemmust be capable of solving a wide range of classical computer vision tasks as well as needing the ability to reason about images.

#### 应用场景

 	The most immediate is as an aid to blind and visually impaired individuals, enabling them to get information about images both on the web and in the real world. For example, as a blind user scrolls through their social media feed, a captioning system can describe the image and then the user could use VQA to query the image to get more insight about the scene.More generally, VQA could be used to improve human-computer interaction as a natural way to query visual content.
